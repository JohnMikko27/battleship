/*
- do i need to be able to associate gameboards with players?
- i can add a board already to each gameboard factory so that i dont need to run the
create gameboard function
- maybe when creating a player, parameters should be name and gameboard, so that
each player is associated with a gameboard
- maybe we would need to create a player with parameters of 
name, gameboard, and an array of ships? or individual ships?

- then we could run like player.getGameboard().placeShip()
- do i need to do the same thing with the ai/computer factory then?
